    signal(x,[samplerate])

Coerce `x` to be a signal, optionally specifying its sample rate (usually in
Hz). All signal operators first call `signal(x)` for each argument. This
means you only need to call `signal` when you want to pass additional
arguments to it.

!!! note

    If you pipe `signal` and pass a sample rate, you must specify the units
    of the sample rate (e.g. `x |> signal(20Hz)`). A unitless number is
    always interpreted as a constant, infinite-length signal (see below).

The type of objects that can be coerced to signals are as follows.
